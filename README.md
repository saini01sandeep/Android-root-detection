# üîç Android Root Detection Monitor

This is a **Frida script** that hooks into Android system calls to help you detect when an app tries to check if the device is rooted.

It shows exactly which root detection methods are being used ‚Äî like `su` commands, debug system properties, or files like `/system/xbin/su`.

Built for Android security testing and reverse engineering.

---

## üí° What It Does

The script listens for root-checking behavior at runtime and prints it to your terminal. It can catch:

- Shell command executions like `su`
- File checks for things like `Superuser` or `busybox`
- Android system properties like `ro.debuggable`
- Build tags like `test-keys`

If any of these are triggered, it lets you know that the app is trying to detect root access ‚Äî and whether it thinks the device is actually rooted.

---

## üß∞ Requirements

- [Frida](https://frida.re) installed (`pip install frida-tools`)
- A rooted device OR emulator (like Genymotion or Android Studio AVD)
- App to test already installed on the device
- USB debugging enabled or connected via TCP

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Use

1. Start your target app on the device.
2. Run this command from your terminal:

```bash
frida -U -n <your.app.package.name> -l android_root_detect.js
frida -U -f <your.app.package.name> -l android_root_detect.js
```

##Example Output 

[RootCheck] Runtime.exec called with: su
[RootCheck] File.exists() on: /system/xbin/su => true
[RootCheck] SystemProperties.get('ro.debuggable') => 1

[!] ‚úÖ Device appears to be ROOTED
Indicators:
   - Runtime.exec('su')
   - File.exists(/system/xbin/su)
   - SystemProperty ro.debuggable=1
